# Optical Character Recognition (OCR) System

This project implements an **OCR (Optical Character Recognition)** system capable of extracting text from images using Python, OpenCV, and Tesseract.

## 📌 Features
- Image preprocessing (grayscale, resizing, thresholding)
- Noise removal using Gaussian blur
- Text extraction using Tesseract OCR engine
- Handles scanned documents, printed text, and clear handwriting
- Displays extracted text as output

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- Python
- OpenCV
- pytesseract (Tesseract OCR engine)
- NumPy

## 🚀 Workflow
1. Load input image
2. Convert to grayscale
3. Remove noise & apply threshold
4. Use Tesseract to extract text
5. Print/display extracted text

## 📚 What I Learned
- Basics of image preprocessing
- How OCR engines detect characters
- Improving accuracy using image enhancement techniques
- Integrating OpenCV with Tesseract

## 📁 Files
- `ocr.py` — main code
- `README.md` — documentation
